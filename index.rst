Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)
=================================

Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) is the process of converting 2D points from images into 3D points
without using depth information, by assuming the points lie on an arbitrary plane.

The project is hosted on `Github`_ by ROS Sports. **Issues and Pull Requests are welcome!**
